","5","It's a beautiful park. The people walking around and doing their own activities make the environment more lively. The cars driving back and forth are also fun to watch.","5","Swimming and football are my favourite activities, though jumping on the trampoline is also a lot of fun.","5","Sounds make the environment a lot more immersive. I especially like the sounds of the fisherman and the footsteps. The ball bouncing seems a lot more realistic with audio too.","Being able to sit and relax on the park benches would be cool.","Maybe add a bigger variety of NPCs around the park with different skins.","It's really peaceful and so much fun to walk around in. I really enjoy exploring environments like this in games. Great work :D","4"

"2024/12/07 7:27:35 pm GMT","4","","5","Controls are based on genre standards so they're immediately familiar. The one thing I missed was a way to exit the game, e.g. by pressing escape","3","Good aesthetic, the framerate took a hit in the areas with a  lot of foliage","3","","4","Overall I like the sound design. There were certain places where it sounded like multiple instances of the breathing sound effect were playing at the same time though, and there's a bit of a delay before hearing any footsetps when walking in water. Ambient sounds were very good.","Maybe an explanation of the controls so the player knows they're not missing something","","","3"

"2024/12/08 1:26:58 am GMT","4","It was really fun to walk around and feel like being in a nice bright park","4","Controls were good, I kept trying to sprint for some reason. Though I don't think it's needed for a nice walk in the park.","5","Really bright and looks great","4","Some nice little interactions like with the ball, trampoline and some of the other playground objects","4","Sound design was really good, there were some points where I jumped off the slide and I expected to hear a thump, but overall really good.","Maybe an easy way to get out of the water if you decide to take a dip.","Nothing specific","I enjoyed the playthrough. Great sound and visuals",""
"2024/12/09 3:19:24 pm GMT","4","","4","controls are simple and intutive","4","","3","","4","like the water sounds likes the splashing water and wading through it","few sounds for maybe slide or see saw","maybe improve character model hand placement on swing","","5"
"2024/12/10 12:01:21 pm GMT","5","I really like the chill idea of it.","5","","4","I love the visual, calming feel to them. 
I wish there was more colour, set it in autumn time maybe for various colours.","3","Interactions are fine, just slightly limited to what you can do.
I kind of wish there was a trigger to when you do certain actions, example when I score a goal, maybe some small acknowledgement that I've done that.","4","Sound is good, but I feel it's missing aspects.
I think a little extra would help. Adding a squeekier noise to the swing and seesaw could work. More rustle of trees in the breeze.","more decor in the park, maybe some more benches or bins, just to feel like a park.","No, everything is good, just minor touch ups really.","",""
