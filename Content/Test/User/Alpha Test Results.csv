Rated it down a bit because there are some areas which could use some improvement, e.g. lack of audio, some glitching with the animations and a river you can fall into with no way out.","4","Camera sensitivity settings could be good. The camera sensitivity was a bit high for me and made me slightly motion sick. Otherwise controls are solid.","4","It is a beautiful environment. It looks like a really nice park to visit. 
The animations were a bit off in places, and the dad in the park seems like a giant when up close.","4","The interactions were so much fun. The football and the trampoline were especially fun. ","More interactions would be great, e.g. the swings. I think the back of the park could use something extra too to make it feel a bit more lively.
Also sound effects would improve the prototype a lot.","The river needs fixing :D swimming or maybe respawning at the start if you fall in could be good. Right now it's just game breaking :D","It's a very pretty and fun experience, and I was able to trigger some funny unintentional behaviour like having the NPCs kick the ball around"

I can imagine talking a walk in the park and going off track while playing this","4","The controls are decent, I wish I could crouch or sprint as well","4","The visuals are great for a prototype, There is some stutter on the tall trees when they wave in the wind. But overall not bad ","3","That interaction that are present are fun, I was able to jump on the trampoline and kick a big football around. I would like some more though, Like the ability to swim in the river, or being able to use the slide and the swing in the playground. 

Being able to greet other people in the park could also be interesting","I think adding some sound would make this a great demo","Better indications when the player is blocked from going out of the map instead of just being an invisible wall ","I got stuck underwater in the river, so some swimming mechanic or way to prevent that would be nice :) "
